There are many ways to install Node.js. I just list one here.

##### `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Then run 

##### `brew install node`

### Run the App

First, make sure the backend is running at port 4000.

Download the repo, cd to the directory, then run

##### `npm install`

##### `npm start`

to run the app in development mode. 

Then, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
